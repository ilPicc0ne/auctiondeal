# Auctiondeal - PRD Decision Log

## Session Information
- **Product Name**: Auctiondeal
- **Session Start**: 2025-09-02 (Base PRD), 2025-09-02 (Expansion)
- **Phase**: PRD Expansion
- **Status**: In Progress

## Key Decisions Made

### Product Name Decision
- **Decision**: Product name "Auctiondeal"
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: User-provided product name
- **Context**: Initial setup for PRD creation process

### Solution Scope Decision
- **Decision**: 3-phase approach - Phase 1: Basic aggregation, Phase 2: Data enrichment (GIS/kataster), Phase 3: International expansion
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: Allows focused MVP while establishing clear expansion path
- **Context**: User clarification on scope boundaries and growth strategy

### Success Metrics Decision
- **Decision**: Monthly Paying Users as North Star KPI, with visitor→trial and trial→purchase conversion as key sub-metrics
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: Revenue-focused metrics align with subscription business model
- **Context**: User prioritized paying users over engagement metrics

### North Star Metrics Update for Phases
- **Decision**: MVP North Star = Unique Monthly Visitors, Phase 1 North Star = Monthly Paying Users
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: MVP focuses on user acquisition and validation before monetization, payments become primary metric once implemented
- **Context**: Clarification during expansion phase - different metrics for different product maturity stages

### MVP Timeline Decision
- **Decision**: Aggressive 30-day timeline to go online (end September 2025)
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: Fast market entry for validation before competition
- **Context**: Bootstrap budget requires quick MVP validation

### MVP Scope Decision
- **Decision**: Focus on core SHAB scraping, map interface, basic filtering with property categories, defer subscription/payments to Phase 1
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: Minimal viable product for market validation within 30-day constraint
- **Context**: User defined strict scope boundaries to meet timeline

## Context Discovered
- **Project Focus**: Swiss auction/foreclosure marketplace (Zwangsversteigerungen)
- **Market Analysis**: Comprehensive 90-page German analysis of Swiss foreclosure market available
- **Target Market**: Swiss real estate foreclosure auctions (primarily), vehicle and goods auctions (secondary)
- **Key Sources**: SHAB (Swiss Commercial Gazette), cantonal publications, court auctions
- **Technical Opportunity**: Automated scraper for auction data aggregation
- **Project Phase**: Market research complete, product definition needed
