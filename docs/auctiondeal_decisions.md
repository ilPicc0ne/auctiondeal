# Auctiondeal - PRD Decision Log

## Session Information
- **Product Name**: Auctiondeal
- **Session Start**: 2025-09-02 (Base PRD), 2025-09-02 (Expansion)
- **Phase**: PRD Expansion  
- **Status**: Complete

## Key Decisions Made

### Product Name Decision
- **Decision**: Product name "Auctiondeal"
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: User-provided product name
- **Context**: Initial setup for PRD creation process

### Solution Scope Decision
- **Decision**: 3-phase approach - Phase 1: Basic aggregation, Phase 2: Data enrichment (GIS/kataster), Phase 3: International expansion
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: Allows focused MVP while establishing clear expansion path
- **Context**: User clarification on scope boundaries and growth strategy

### Success Metrics Decision
- **Decision**: Monthly Paying Users as North Star KPI, with visitorâ†’trial and trialâ†’purchase conversion as key sub-metrics
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: Revenue-focused metrics align with subscription business model
- **Context**: User prioritized paying users over engagement metrics

### North Star Metrics Update for Phases
- **Decision**: MVP North Star = Unique Monthly Visitors, Phase 1 North Star = Monthly Paying Users
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: MVP focuses on user acquisition and validation before monetization, payments become primary metric once implemented
- **Context**: Clarification during expansion phase - different metrics for different product maturity stages

### MVP Timeline Decision
- **Decision**: Aggressive 30-day timeline to go online (end September 2025)
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: Fast market entry for validation before competition
- **Context**: Bootstrap budget requires quick MVP validation

### MVP Scope Decision
- **Decision**: Focus on core SHAB scraping, map interface, basic filtering with property categories, defer subscription/payments to Phase 1
- **Date**: 2025-09-02
- **Rationale**: Minimal viable product for market validation within 30-day constraint
- **Context**: User defined strict scope boundaries to meet timeline

## Context Discovered
- **Project Focus**: Swiss auction/foreclosure marketplace (Zwangsversteigerungen)
- **Market Analysis**: Comprehensive 90-page German analysis of Swiss foreclosure market available
- **Target Market**: Swiss real estate foreclosure auctions (primarily), vehicle and goods auctions (secondary)
- **Key Sources**: SHAB (Swiss Commercial Gazette), cantonal publications, court auctions
- **Technical Opportunity**: Automated scraper for auction data aggregation
- **Project Phase**: Market research complete, product definition needed

## Key Technical Decisions This Session
- **Map Pin Interactions**: Desktop hover cards vs mobile direct click, multi-object zoom behavior
- **Swiss Value Formatting**: "950k" for under 1M, "1.25mio" for over 1M CHF
- **Color-Coded Pins**: Land(Green), MFH(Blue), EFH(Light blue), Commercial(Violet), Various(Yellow), Parking(White)
- **OpenStreetMap**: Cost-effective mapping solution for MVP
- **LLM Processing**: Required for fuzzy German text parsing in auctionObjects and remarks fields
- **Documentation Structure**: Centralized in docs/ folder, git workflow with meaningful commits

## Data Architecture Decisions (2025-09-02 CUJ Session)
- **Database Schema**: 3-table structure (auctions, objects, shab_publications) with defined relationships
- **Data Retention**: Complete XML storage for all SHAB publications with structured field extraction
- **Primary Keys**: Internal auction UUIDs with separate SHAB publication tracking (meta_id, publication_nr, subsection_id)
- **Auction-Publication Mapping**: 1:many relationships, MVP processes initial publications + cancellations only
- **Extensibility**: Objects table designed for future data source integration (aerial imagery, GIS, Kataster)
- **Documentation Separation**: Technical architecture moved to dedicated `auctiondeal_architecture.md` document

## PRD Restructuring Session (2025-09-04)
- **Challenge Identified**: Current PRD became convoluted through iterative edits, mixing content types and logical flow
- **Solution Approach**: Complete restructuring using clean template structure (`context/prd_template.md`)
- **Restructuring Strategy**: 
  - Create new `auctiondeal_prd1.md` file with clean 12-chapter structure
  - Consolidate detailed CUJs into concise journeys (details â†’ user stories)
  - Organize features logically: System features first, then user features by workflow
  - Separate MVP from post-MVP features (placeholders)
- **Progress Completed**:
  - âœ… Chapter 1: Problem Statement (written to file with 5 core pain points)
  - ðŸ“‹ Chapter 2: Business Context & Opportunity (drafted, pending approval)
- **Remaining Work**: Chapters 3-12 with clean content mapping and consolidation

## PRD Quality Fixes Applied
- **Pricing Math Correction**: Fixed annual discount calculation (CHF 13-17 average vs CHF 12-16 effective monthly rate)
- **Feature Scope Clarification**: MVP processes only primary property per auction, multi-object handling deferred to post-MVP
- **Timeline Consistency**: Clarified subscription launch timeline references for revenue targets
- **Duplicate Content**: Identified revenue target duplication (lines 81-87 vs 323-328) for future consolidation
