# Auctiondeal PRD - Comprehensive Specification

## 1. Problem Definition & Strategic Context

### Problem Statement

**Core User Pain Point**: Swiss auction seekers cannot efficiently discover relevant opportunities in their area or gain information advantage over other buyers due to SHAB's limited, unfiltered text-only format and fragmented supplementary sources.

**Specific Pain Points**:

- **Discovery Problem**: SHAB.ch provides all auction data but as unfiltered text objects without property type, location radius, or other critical filters
- **Information Disadvantage**: Limited auction details force manual research across inconsistent cantonal/municipal sites (e.g., betreibungsamt-ag.ch has rich data, others barely functional)
- **Notification Gap**: No systematic way to get alerted about relevant opportunities (e.g., "multi-family homes within 30km of my location")
- **Research Inefficiency**: Each interesting auction requires manual investigation across multiple sources to gather competitive intelligence

**Impact on Target Users**:

- Individual investors miss opportunities in their criteria due to inability to filter SHAB's data stream
- Small real estate firms cannot efficiently monitor territories without manual daily screening
- Information asymmetry favors buyers with dedicated research resources or local insider knowledge

### Strategic Context

**Market Opportunity**:

- **Market Inefficiency**: Existing solutions (CHF 15-50/month) serve market demand but rely on manual processes, creating opportunity for automated, feature-rich alternative
- **Target Addressable Market**: Swiss individual property investors and small real estate firms (2-10 employees) currently underserved by expensive professional tools
- **Market Validation**: Competitor existence at CHF 15-50/month price points demonstrates willingness to pay for auction aggregation services
- **Growth Opportunity**: Automation advantage enables competitive pricing while delivering superior filtering and data enrichment capabilities

**Business Driver**:

- **Immediate**: Capture market share from existing manual-process competitors through automation advantage
- **Long-term**: Scalable technology platform enables expansion to other European foreclosure markets with minimal adaptation
- **Competitive Moat**: LLM-powered data enrichment and advanced filtering create differentiation that manual competitors cannot easily replicate

**User Research Insights**: Based on comprehensive 90-page Swiss auction market analysis:

- SHAB serves as mandatory central publication but lacks filtering capabilities
- Existing aggregators validate market demand but have scalability constraints due to manual processes
- Geographic filtering and proximity alerts exist in current solutions but can be significantly improved
- Information enrichment (GIS, imagery, zoning) provides competitive advantage opportunity

**Competitive Analysis**:

- **Existing Aggregators**: AuctionHome, Local Auction, Dein-ImmoCenter, Zwangsversteigerung.ch (CHF 15-50/month)
- **Current Limitations**: Manual data collection processes, limited filtering capabilities, high maintenance overhead
- **Market Gap**: Competitors rely on manual labor and are "proud" of human curation, creating scalability constraints
- **Our Opportunity**: LLM-powered automation enables richer data processing, advanced filtering, and scalable expansion to other countries with minimal adaptation
- **Technical Advantage**:
  - Fully automated pipeline vs. manual processes allows superior user experience at competitive pricing
  - Advanced scraping enables content enrichment from multiple sources: aerial imagery, street-view, GIS data, Kataster (building zones), providing superior value proposition
  - **Potential Future Extension**: Crowdsourced property inspection network could provide on-site visuals, but not core to initial differentiation strategy

### Success Hypothesis

**MVP Success Hypothesis** (30 days to launch):

If we provide centralized access to all Swiss foreclosure auctions with intuitive map-based filtering, supported by targeted marketing (Google Ads, FB Ads), we will achieve:

- 100+ unique visitors in month 1 post-launch
- 20% return visitor rate within 30 days
- 40% of users navigate beyond homepage
- 25% actively use core features (map interaction or filtering)

This validates core value proposition and user engagement patterns before implementing subscription monetization.

**Beta Registration Phase** (Month 2-3):

Building on MVP validation, if we implement user registration while keeping all features free, we will achieve:

- 60% of active users convert to registered beta users
- 500+ registered beta users by Month 3
- 40% weekly active user rate among registered users
- Foundation user database for Phase 1 conversion

**Phase 1 Success Hypothesis** (Freemium Subscription Launch):

Building on beta user base, if we implement freemium model with 7-day trial and annual discount options, we will achieve:

- **300 paid subscribers within first 6 months** of subscription launch
- **1,000 paid subscribers within 18 months** of subscription launch
- 15% trial-to-paid conversion rate from 7-day free trial
- CHF 13-17 average monthly subscription revenue per user (accounting for annual discount)
- 85% monthly subscriber retention rate
- 30% annual subscription adoption rate (20% discount incentive)

This validates sustainable monetization through strategic conversion funnel and justifies expanded feature development and market expansion.

## 2. Solution Architecture & Scope

### Solution Overview

**Product Concept**: A fully automated Swiss auction aggregation platform that scrapes SHAB XML data daily, processes and structures foreclosure auction information, and presents opportunities through an intuitive map-based interface with intelligent filtering capabilities.

**Key Value Proposition**: Users get comprehensive auction intelligence in one place - eliminating manual research across fragmented SHAB text data and inconsistent cantonal sites - with automated processing and superior filtering at competitive pricing.

**Technical Approach**:

- SHAB XML API integration for legal data compliance and completeness
- Real-time data processing with duplicate detection algorithms
- Interactive Swiss map visualization with property pins
- Progressive web application optimized for mobile and desktop research workflows

### Core Features (MVP)

#### Mainpage Architecture

The Auctiondeal platform consists of four integrated components that work together to provide comprehensive auction discovery and analysis:

1. **Filters** - Restrict the scope of map pins and list results through targeted search criteria
2. **Interactive Map** - Visual exploration with color-coded property pins and geographical context
3. **Results List** - Synchronized list view showing property cards for current map scope and active filters
4. **Property Detail Page** - Comprehensive property information accessed by clicking on map pins or result cards

#### Feature Implementation

**Feature Area 1: Data Collection & Processing**

- **Purpose:** Automated SHAB XML ingestion and parsing for structured property data
- **User Stories:**
  - As a **system**, I want to fetch daily SHAB XML publications via API using `publicationDate` and `subRubrics=SB01` filters, so that no foreclosure auction announcements are missed
  - As a **system**, I want to parse `auctionObjects` HTML content to extract property address, estimated value ("Rechtskräftige Betreibungsamtliche Schätzung: CHF X"), and property details, so that users can search and filter effectively
  - As a **system**, I want to extract the first/primary property from `auctionObjects` for MVP, so that complex multi-object auctions are handled simply initially
  - As a **system**, I want to store complete raw XML linked to auction objects using `publicationNumber` as identifier, so that multiple XML versions (original, cancellations, updates) are preserved
  - As a **system**, I want to detect duplicate auctions using `publicationNumber` matching, so that users see clean, non-redundant listings
  - As a **system**, I want to monitor `publicationState` changes from PUBLISHED to CANCELLED, so that users have current accurate information
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Daily automated SHAB API calls with error handling and retry logic
  - HTML parsing of `auctionObjects` extracts: property address, estimated value (CHF amount), property type/details
  - Duplicate prevention using `publicationNumber` as unique key
  - Raw XML storage with auction object linking for future reprocessing
  - Status updates reflected within 24 hours
- **Future Enhancement:** Parse multiple properties within single `auctionObjects` element
- **Priority:** P0 (MVP required)
